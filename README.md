## Description

This application is a fully functioning Google Books API search engine built with a RESTful API, which has been **refactored** into a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server and Client. The app was built using the MERN stack with a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server and API.

### Code Refactor Tasks:

- Set up an Apollo Server to use GraphQL queries and mutations to fetch and modify data, replacing the existing RESTful API.
- Modify the existing authentication middleware so that it works in the context of a GraphQL API.
- Create an Apollo Provider so that requests can communicate with an Apollo Server.
- Deploy application to Render with a MongoDB database using MongoDB Atlas.
